# Deep learning literature

In this repository, I list the papers I have been reading and studying pertaining to the implementations of deep learning algorithms in various fields.

Notes and/or comments on those papers, if any will be included next to each paper.

<H6>
Note: 
  
  
- My interests include but is not limited to, deep learning for 3D point clouds, optimisation approaches and CV in general. 


- I, therefore, focus on **deep learning techniques for computer vision**, **combinatorial optimisation** and **belief propagation systems**.


- I also include papers related to the application of deep learning approaches in various other aspects where I will try to give overviews as well.


- Feel free to let me know if you have any questions/comments pertaining to any of the items from the lists below by contacting me at *goomanee.salvish@gmail.com*.
