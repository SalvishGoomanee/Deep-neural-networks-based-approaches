# Deep Learning literature

In this post, I list the papers I have been reading and studying pertaining to the implementations of deep learning algorithms in various fields.

Notes and/or comments on those papers, if any will be included next to each paper.

<H6>
Note: The papers are not in any order of complexity and/or grouped under any particular theme. I, myself, am interested in deep learning for 3D point clouds and optimisation approaches, and CV in general. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions pertaining to any items in the lists below.
